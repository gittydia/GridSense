# gridsense

The **gridsense** is a powerful tool designed for Formula 1 enthusiasts, analysts, and teams. It provides real-time predictions and insights into race outcomes, weather conditions, and session performances (Qualifying and Practice). The app also displays historical and live data to help users make informed decisions.

## Features

### 1. **Race Winner Prediction**
   - Predicts the likely winner of the race based on historical data, driver performance, and track conditions.
   - **Output**: Percentage probability of each driver winning the race.

### 2. **Qualifying and Practice Predictions**
   - Forecasts the performance of drivers and teams during Qualifying and Practice sessions.
   - **Output**: Predicted top performers and their likelihood of securing pole position or leading practice sessions.

### 3. **Weather Prediction**
   - Provides accurate weather forecasts for race weekends, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
   - **Output**: Weather conditions for each session (Practice, Qualifying, Race).

### 4. **Data Display**
   - Displays historical race data, live telemetry, and session results in an easy-to-read format.
   - **Output**: Interactive charts, tables, and graphs for better visualization.

### 4. **Championship Winner Prediction**
   - Predicts who will likely to win the championship in both driver and constructor based on the 
   historical data, driver performance, team performance, and car performance. 
   - **Output**: Percentage probability of each driver and constructor winning the race.

## How It Works

The app uses a combination of **machine learning models**, **historical F1 data**, and **real-time APIs** to generate predictions and display data. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Historical race data (e.g., lap times, tire performance, driver stats).
   - Real-time weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
   - Live telemetry data from F1 sessions (fastf1).

2. **Prediction Models**:
   - Race Winner Prediction: Uses a classifier model (e.g., Random Forest) trained on historical race outcomes.
   - Weather Prediction: Integrates weather APIs to provide real-time forecasts.
   - Qualifying/Practice Predictions: Analyzes past session data to predict performance.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Interactive dashboards built with libraries like Paparse, Chartjs.
   - Tables and charts for displaying session results and predictions.

## Installation
